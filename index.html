        <h2>1-Definition of Minecraft:</h2>
        <p>
          Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was
          created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language.
          Following several early test versions, it was released as a paid
          public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before releasing in
          November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft
          has since been ported to several other platforms and is the
          best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and
          126 million monthly active users as of 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D
          world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw
          materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks.
          Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs",
          as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same
          world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must
          acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a
          creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can
          modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and
          being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social
          media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon
          conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also
          been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of
          computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been
          built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property
          were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off
          games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode,
          Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.
